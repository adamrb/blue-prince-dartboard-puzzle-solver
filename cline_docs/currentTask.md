# Current Task: "Repeat X Times" Logic Fix

## Current Objectives
- ✅ Fix the "repeat x times" functionality in the dartboard puzzle solver
  - ✅ Analyze how the feature should work based on The Blue Prince game mechanics
  - ✅ Implement the correct logic for repeating operations
  - ✅ Improve the step-by-step display of calculations for better clarity
- Test the fixed implementation with various puzzle scenarios

## Relevant Context
We've identified and fixed an issue with the "repeat x times" functionality in the dartboard puzzle solver. The original implementation was cascading operations (applying them sequentially), but based on research into The Blue Prince game mechanics, the correct behavior is:

- For "repeat 2/3/4 times" operations:
  - Addition: Add the number x times (multiply by x)
  - Subtraction: Subtract the number x times (multiply by x)
  - Multiplication: Multiply by the number x times (raise to power x)
  - Division: Divide by the number x times (raise to power x)

The implementation now correctly calculates the effective value for repeated operations and applies it once, rather than chaining multiple applications of the same operation.

Key changes:
- Added a new utility function `applyRepeatedOperation` to calculate the effective value of a repeated operation
- Updated the `calculateEquation` function to properly handle and display repeating operations
- Improved the step-by-step explanation in the calculation to show how repeated operations are resolved

## Next Steps
1. Test the implementation with various puzzle scenarios to ensure correctness
2. Consider adding visual indication of how repeat operations work in the UI
3. Update README to document the corrected behavior
4. Continue code maintenance and address any new TypeScript warnings if they appear

## Related Roadmap Tasks
This work addresses the following goals from projectRoadmap.md:
- Create a web-based dart board puzzle solver for The Blue Prince game
- Allow users to click and mark segments to solve puzzles
- Puzzle calculations function correctly following the game's rules
