# Current Task: Implement Partial (1/3) Segment Shading

## Current Objectives
- ✅ Implement 1/3 segment shading functionality
  - ✅ Create a SegmentDialog component for color and fill type selection
  - ✅ Add SVG masking for partial (1/3) segment visualization
  - ✅ Update calculation logic to use 1/3 of number values for partially filled segments
  - ✅ Improve PuzzleSolver instructions to explain the new feature

## Relevant Context
We've added the ability to shade only 1/3 of a dartboard segment and use 1/3 of the number value in calculations. This feature enhances puzzle-solving capabilities by allowing more nuanced operations. The implementation includes a dialog-based approach for better user experience, similar to the BullseyeDialog component.

Key changes:
- Added a new SegmentDialog component that allows users to select:
  - The operation color (blue, yellow, pink, purple)
  - Whether to use full or 1/3 fill for the segment
- Implemented SVG masking to visually display segments with only 1/3 filled
- Updated the calculation logic in dartboardUtils.ts to handle the partial segments
- Added a special parameter to applyOperation to divide numbers by 3 when a segment is marked as partial
- Updated the PuzzleSolver component's instructions to include information about partial segments

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding more fill types (e.g., 2/3 or 1/2)
2. Add tooltips to explain the partial segment functionality to new users
3. Test the application with various puzzle scenarios that use the partial fill feature
4. Add this feature to the project README

## Previous Task
Added a GitHub source link to the application by updating the footer section in App.tsx and styling it in App.css to match the application's design.

## Related Roadmap Tasks
This work addresses the following goals from projectRoadmap.md:
- Create a web-based dart board puzzle solver for The Blue Prince game
- Allow users to click and mark segments to solve puzzles
- Puzzle calculations function correctly following the game's rules
- Enhance the UI for improved puzzle solving
