## Relevant Context
We've completed the development of the dart board puzzle solver application and now need to optimize it for search engines to help players of The Blue Prince find this tool when looking for help with the Billiard Room puzzle.

Key information included in the README:

## Next Steps
1. Rename repository to "blue-prince-dartboard-puzzle-solver" on GitHub

4. Consider adding screenshots of the application to the README
