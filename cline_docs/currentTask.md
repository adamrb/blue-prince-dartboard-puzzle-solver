# Current Task: GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## Current Objectives
- ✅ Update README.md for better SEO targeting The Blue Prince game
- ✅ Add detailed information about the Billiard Room dartboard puzzle mechanics
- ✅ Fix GitHub Pages deployment issues
  - ✅ Update `vite.config.ts` base path to match new repository name
  - ✅ Update `package.json` name to match new repository name
  - ✅ Modernize GitHub Actions workflow with latest action versions
  - ✅ Update GitHub Actions components to appropriate versions to fix deprecated dependency issue
- ✅ Prepare for repository renaming to "blue-prince-dartboard-puzzle-solver"

## Relevant Context
We've completed the development of the dart board puzzle solver application and fixed the GitHub Pages deployment issues that arose after renaming the repository from "billiard-puzzle-solver" to "blue-prince-dartboard-puzzle-solver".

The following key updates were made:
- Changed base URL in Vite configuration to match the new repository name
- Updated the project name in package.json
- Upgraded GitHub Actions workflow with latest action versions to resolve artifact upload errors
- Updated Node.js version from 18 to 20 in the workflow
- Updated GitHub Actions components to their latest compatible versions:
  - `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-node@v4`, `actions/configure-pages@v4`
  - `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` (the latest version as of April 2025)
  - `actions/deploy-pages@v4`
- Fixed "Missing download info for actions/upload-artifact@v3" error by using appropriate versions that align with GitHub's deprecation schedule (v3 actions were deprecated on January 30, 2025)

## Next Steps
1. Verify successful GitHub Pages deployment after recent fixes
2. Monitor SEO performance and user engagement
3. Consider adding screenshots of the application to the README
4. Consider implementing additional features from "Future Scalability Considerations" section in projectRoadmap.md

## Related Roadmap Tasks
