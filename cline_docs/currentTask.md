# Current Task: Add GitHub Source Link

## Current Objectives
- ✅ Add a GitHub source link to the application
  - ✅ Update the footer section in App.tsx to include a link to the GitHub repository
  - ✅ Style the GitHub link in App.css to match the application's design

## Relevant Context
We've added a link to the GitHub repository in the application footer to make the source code easily accessible to users. This allows players of The Blue Prince who find the tool useful to explore how it was built or potentially contribute improvements.

Key changes:
- Added a link to the GitHub repository (https://github.com/adamrb/blue-prince-dartboard-puzzle-solver/) in the footer section of App.tsx
- Added appropriate styling for the source code link in App.css

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding GitHub Stars counter or other GitHub-related information
2. Update project README with recent developments
3. Test the application to ensure the link works correctly
4. Consider adding a more prominent "Fork me on GitHub" banner for increased visibility

## Previous Task
Successfully fixed the "repeat x times" functionality in the dartboard puzzle solver by implementing the correct logic for repeated operations:
- For "repeat 2/3/4 times" operations:
  - Addition: Add the number x times (multiply by x)
  - Subtraction: Subtract the number x times (multiply by x)
  - Multiplication: Multiply by the number x times (raise to power x)
  - Division: Divide by the number x times (raise to power x)

## Related Roadmap Tasks
This work addresses the following goals from projectRoadmap.md:
- Create a web-based dart board puzzle solver for The Blue Prince game
- Allow users to click and mark segments to solve puzzles
- Puzzle calculations function correctly following the game's rules
